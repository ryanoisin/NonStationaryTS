# NonStationaryTS
Code archive to reproduce all analysis, simulations and figures in the paper Ryan, O., Haslbeck, J.M.B \& Waldorp ,L. (preprint) "xxx"  (preprint: <https://psyarxiv.com/>).

# Overview

This repository includes the following files:

- `analysis_figures.R`: Creates all figures and stored them in `/figures`. Where appropriate loads `.RDS` files from simulations created by other analysis files
- `analysis_adfsim.R`: Code to simualte the performance of the DF test, saves results in `/files/simresults_adftest.RDS`
- `analysis_mldetrend.R`: Simulates the performance of different multilevel detrendign approaches, saves results in `/files/simres_mldetrend.RDS` 
- `aux_functions.R`: Includes auxiliary functions for plotting, data generation and manipulation, and simulation studies
- `adf_flow.R`: Function to perform DF testing based on sequential model testing
- `/files`: Includes simulation result files stored as `.RDS` 
- `/figures`: Stores figures generated by `analysis_figures.R`
